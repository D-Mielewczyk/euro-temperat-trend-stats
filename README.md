# European Temperature Trend Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze climate data from Europe to identify trends in temperature changes over recent decades. The analysis utilizes the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) and is implemented using AWS EMR, Apache Spark, and Python.

## Objectives

- Select 5 regions with the most significant temperature changes.
- Create visualizations showing temperature changes over time.
- Publish the source code and report on GitHub.
- Document the project in this README.md file.

## Data Source

European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D)
[https://www.ecad.eu/](https://www.ecad.eu/)

## Technologies Used

- AWS EMR
- Apache Spark
- Python

## Project Requirements

1. **Selection of Regions**:
   - Identify 5 regions in Europe with the largest temperature changes.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Create visualizations to depict temperature changes over time.

3. **Publication**:
   - Publish the source code and project report on GitHub.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Write the project report and save it in the README.md file.

## Getting Started

### download.py
This Python script is designed to fetch, extract, and format weather data from ECA&D. 
The data is fetched in the form of a zip file, extracted, and then formatted into csv format. 

**File structure**: The script creates directories for the original data and the formatted CSV data. 
The original data is stored in the `./original_data` directory, and the formatted CSV data is stored in the `./csv_data` directory.
Each type of temperature data has its own folder ("mean", "min", "max"). 
The resulting csv temperature data is saved **without** the leading string and zeroes.
This means every type has the same name corresponding to the station source identifier.


**Station Data**: The script also creates a CSV file for station locations from a specified text file. 
The source file is located in the `./original_data/mean` directory and is named `stations.txt`. 
The script skips the header of this file and saves the data as `stations.csv` in the current directory.

The resulting CSV files have the following fields:

| Field | Description                                               |
| ----- |-----------------------------------------------------------|
| STAID | Station identifier                                        |
| SOUID | Source identifier                                         |
| DATE  | Date in "YYYYMMDD" format                                 |
| TN    | Minimum temperature in 0.1 Â°C                             |
| Q_TN  | Quality code for TN (0='valid'; 1='suspect'; 9='missing') |

This example is for minimum temperature "TN". Max temperature is saved with "TX" and mean with "TG".
