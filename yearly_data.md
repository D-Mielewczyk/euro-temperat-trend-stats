# Pyspark_queries.py result

The file calculates an average temperature for each year for every station.

The source directory is `cleaned_data` and every folder within it (`min`, `max`, `mean`).

The destination directory is `yearly_data` with the same folder structure. The only difference is that the processed data has a folder for each station in the format "STAID=X".
Each station folder contains 1 CSV file corresponding to the station with a name generated by Spark.

This file's logging information could be improved.
